                                    <li><p>During my final semester at Dawson, I had the opportunity to participate in a volunteer internship. This unique experience was a collaboration between Dawson and Concordia University within the newly established Applied AI Institute. The primary focus of this internship revolved around gaining hands-on knowledge about harnessing Artificial Intelligence to devise innovative solutions across diverse domains, including climate change, smart cities, healthcare, transportation, aerospace, cybersecurity, privacy, and trust. My project was related to utilizing AI to help mitigate areas of cybersecurity that require intense manual labor such as Penetration Testing. Machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning, was used to advance an agent (AI) to gain rewards by attacking a smart grid using a process known as the Markov-Decision Process where the agent is trained to find vulnerabilities in the system, such that vulnerable areas in the system become apparent so they can be fixed and further protected. OpenAI gym and Cyberbattlesim were utilized to perform these tasks and were further benchmarked. Furthermore, by the end of the internship my project teammates and I designed the poster below and created a slideshow to present it to judges and organisation directors.</p></li>
